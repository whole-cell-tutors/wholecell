# WholeCell Summer School

The primary aim is to learn about standards for modelling and simulation in computational biology.  But a secondary aim is to enjoy modelling, coding and diagramming the whole-cell model using openly available software and COMBINE standards.

This repository is putting together all modules of the "whole-cell model" published in [Cell](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22817898) by Karr *et al.*.
